# Vuln
Vulnerability Agentic AI 
This is the first agent Project for testing the agentic AI methods


Agentic AI Capabilities:
Asset Discovery & Inventory

Vulnerability Scanning Integration

Threat Intelligence Ingestion

Vulnerability Prioritization (CVSS + context-aware risk scoring)

Remediation Suggestions or Automation

Human-in-the-loop Feedback & Reporting


Part 2: Architecture Blueprint
ðŸ§± System Components:
Component	Description
Agentic Core (LLM-based)	Decision-making engine (e.g., OpenAI GPT, local LLM, or fine-tuned model)
Scan Integrators	Interfaces with scanners (e.g., Nessus, OpenVAS, Qualys)
Threat Feed Parsers	Pulls CVE data, CISA KEV list, exploit databases
Asset Inventory	Pulls from CMDB, AWS/GCP, etc.
Risk Engine	Computes contextual risk scores (CVSS + asset value + exposure)
Remediation Engine	Maps vulnerabilities to patches, configs, and mitigation steps
Action/Workflow Engine	Integrates with Jira, Ansible, Terraform, or CrowdStrike/Falcon
Frontend	Dashboard for monitoring, validation, and human review


 Part 3: Tools and Stack

 Function	Tool Suggestions
Agentic Reasoning	GPT-4 API / LlamaIndex / LangChain / CrewAI
Data Ingestion	Python, FastAPI, Apache Kafka
Vulnerability Scanners	OpenVAS, Tenable/Nessus, Qualys
Threat Intelligence	CVE/NVD feeds, ExploitDB, Shodan API
Asset Management	AWS/GCP SDKs, CMDB API, CrowdStrike
Risk Scoring	Custom logic + CVSS calculator
Automation	Ansible, Terraform, OSQuery
Frontend	Streamlit, React.js
Deployment	Docker, Kubernetes, AWS ECS/Lambda

Part 4: Code Skeleton (Simplified MVP)


How to RUn the code "

# 5. Sample curl test:
# curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/analyze \
# -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
# -d '[{"cve_id":"CVE-2023-1234","cvss_score":9.8,"asset":"web01","description":"Remote code execution in Apache"}]'

# 6. .env (not committed)
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here

# 7. To run locally:
# docker build -t vuln-agent .
# docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env vuln-agent
